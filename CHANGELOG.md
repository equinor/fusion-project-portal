## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- #### Initial Release of the Fusion Project Portal

  The application is designed to provide a comprehensive display of fusion applications, tailored to the selected context and context type. By scoping the displayed applications, users can gain a better understanding of the available options.
  This solution will offer support for all fusion and custom context types, although the current version is currently limited to the context type 'Project Master'.

  > We aim to design a system that provides users with a streamlined workflow, by offering applications in a sequence or based on the project timeline, and understanding the user's requirements, tasks, and goals within their workflow. Identify the various applications or tools that can assist in completing these tasks.
