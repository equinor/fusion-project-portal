This workflow includes careful management of code changes, rigorous quality checks, automated testing, and seamless integration with our deployment system. It aims to ensure smoother releases, fewer errors, better code quality, and improved teamwork among different departments. This change is part of our ongoing commitment to delivering top-notch software while simplifying our release process.
