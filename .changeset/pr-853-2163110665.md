BREAKING CHANGE: 

Updates the API endpoints that gives Portal Apps as list of objects:

{portalId:guid}/apps
{portalId:guid}/contexts/{contextId:guid}/apps
Now instead, these endpoint returns a list of appKeys (strings).

The old ones:

{portalId:guid}/appkeys
{portalId:guid}/contexts/{contextId:guid}/appkeys
are now identical, and are deprecated and will be removed when front-end has adopted the updated endpoints.

In addition some refactoring has been done. As a result, compiler warnings has been greatly reduced
